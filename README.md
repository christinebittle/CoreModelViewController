## Test your understanding!
- Use your browser developer tools Element Inspector + View Page Source to look at the *rendered* HTML output for /Pizza/Welcome, /Pizza/Menu, and /Pizza/Order
- Use your browser developer tools Network to look at the HTTP requests GET /Pizza/Welcome, GET Pizza/Menu, POST /Pizza/Order
