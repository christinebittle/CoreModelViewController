# Core MVC
This project uses Models, Views, and Controllers to create an MVC application for an online store.

## Test your understanding!
- Observe the definitions in Models/PizzaOrder.cs, including their private fields and public property accessors
- Observe how information is SET in the PizzaController Order Method
- Observe how information is GET in Views/Pizza/Order.cshtml
- Use the example as a reference to create your own Model!
